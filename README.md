# observability-sandbox

I am taking an existing project that has a three tier app since I'm too lazy right now to create my own.  The point of this isn't to design that.  The point is to wire it up with Prometheus and spit out metrics worth a damn.  

## TODO
1.  Get app running.
1.  Install Prometheus on each tier.
1.  Setup basic metrics.  (CPU, Memory, etc..)
1.  Create a dummy script to generate load. 
1.  ...
1.  Profit?
